# Python keywords

# See W3 Schools for a full list: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp

# 1 False - Represents the boolean value false.
# 2 None - Represents a null value or no value at all.
# 3 True - Represents the boolean value true.
# 4 and - A logical operator that returns True if both operands are true.
# 5 as - Used to create an alias while importing a module.
# 6 assert - Used for debugging purposes to test a condition.
# 7 async - Declares an asynchronous function.
# 8 await - Used to pause execution until the result of an asynchronous function is available.
# 9 break - Exits a loop prematurely.
# 10 class - Defines a new user-defined class.
# 11 continue - Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one.
# 12 def - Defines a new function.
# 13 del - Deletes a reference to an object.
# 14 elif - Used in conditional statements, stands for "else if."
# 15 else - Specifies a block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
# 16 except - Catches and handles exceptions in a try block.
# 17 finally - A block that will execute after try and except, regardless of
# whether an exception occurred.
# 18 for - Used to create a for loop to iterate over a sequence.
# 19 from - Used to import specific parts of a module.
# 20 global - Declares a variable as global, allowing it to be accessed outside its local scope.
# 21 if - Used to make a conditional statement.
# 22 import - Imports a module into the current namespace.
# 23 in - Tests for membership in a sequence (like lists or strings).
# 24 is - Tests for object identity; checks if two references point to the same object.
# 25 lambda - Creates an anonymous function.
# 26 nonlocal - Declares a variable to be non-local, allowing it to be modified in nested functions.
# 27 not - A logical operator that negates a boolean expression.
# 28 or - A logical operator that returns True if at least one operand is true.
# 29 pass - A null statement; does nothing when executed.
# 30 raise - Used to raise an exception.
# 31 return - Exits a function and optionally passes back a value.
# 32 try - Starts a block of code to test for exceptions.
# 33 while - Creates a while loop that continues as long as a condition is true.
# 34 with - Used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager.
# 35 yield - Used in a function to make it a generator, allowing it to return values one at a time.
# 36 break - Exits a loop prematurely.
# 37 class - Defines a new user-defined class.
# 38 continue - Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one.
# 39 def - Defines a new function.
# 40 del - Deletes a reference to an object.
# 41 elif - Used in conditional statements, stands for "else if."
# 42 else - Specifies a block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
# 43 except - Catches and handles exceptions in a try block.
# 44 finally - A block that will execute after try and except, regardless of
# whether an exception occurred.
# 45 for - Used to create a for loop to iterate over a sequence.
# 46 from - Used to import specific parts of a module.
# 47 global - Declares a variable as global, allowing it to be accessed outside its local scope.
# 48 if - Used to make a conditional statement.
# 49 import - Imports a module into the current namespace.
# 50 in - Tests for membership in a sequence (like lists or strings).
